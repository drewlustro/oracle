# Oracle

Oracle is a minimal and responsive [Ghost](http://ghost.org) theme focusing on your content. It is made for my personal website at [drewlustro.com](http://drewlustro.com), but of course you may use it if you like.

## History &amp; Thanks

Oracle started as a fork of the [Rolls Royce](https://github.com/roycehaynes/rollsroyce) theme by Royce Haynes. It has moved significantly away from the theme by adding additional responsiveness, switched to the Gulp task runner, and added significant Sass libs.

Thanks to [@JohnONolan](http://twitter.com/JohnONolan), [@ErisDS](http://twitter.com/ErisDS), and the Ghost team for creating this blog platform. Special shout out to [Dave Gamache](http://blog.davegamache.com/articles), the original designer and [Royce Haynes](https://github.com/roycehaynes/rollsroyce) for the original fork.
